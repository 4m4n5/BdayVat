        Since its your bithday today, it seems customary to have a photo album somewhere here. This contains all of your pictures i could get my hands on. I seriously hope that looking at them will atleast make you smile if not more. So go ahead, click on the link. Cheers! (ps: i dont know why but its showing only the first four pictures, some problem with the code. Could not fix it. But you get the idea... :-P)

        This is where i should write something touching which would make you all emotional. But as you know how pathetic i am at all that, I would just pretend that i worte something emotional there. [emotional content goes here]. Now that we are done with that, let me tell you why i took the pain to create all this on your birthday. Sometimes when i think about you, i wonder how can someone be so great at being great. Like i have told you, you are really the best person i have ever met in my life, and i doubt that i would ever meet someone half as good as you. So, whatever i do for you will always be a fraction to how much grateful i am that i met you. Happy Birthday Vatsala. I hope that this year you get everything you wish for and having said that i seriosly hope that you wish that i get a good CGPA :-P. I wish that you get happier with everyday that comes ahead.
