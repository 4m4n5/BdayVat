        Visual weight revolves around the idea that distinct elements in a design have varying heaviness relative to each other. 
        Sometimes visual weight is obvious, such as in the case where larger objects appear heavier than smaller objects because they take up more space. 
        In certain instances, it’s not so cut and dry, such as in the case of color. Some colors may look as if they are heavier and more dominant than others.
